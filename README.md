# Cognitive-Bias-Dataset-Generator
This project generates synthetic dialogue datasets that simulate cognitive biases in human decision-making. It leverages Google Gemini (for question generation) and Groq LLM (for biased responses) to create structured datasets with questions, AI suggestions, biased answers, and confidence scores.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Generates unique decision-making questions across diverse domains (finance, health, career, relationships, etc.)

âœ… Provides AI suggestions that may subtly influence participant answers

âœ… Simulates 33+ cognitive biases (e.g., Anchoring, Confirmation Bias, Authority Bias, etc.)

âœ… Assigns confidence scores tailored to each bias type

âœ… Handles API quota errors with key rotation and fallback questions

âœ… Saves outputs in:

A combined JSON dataset

Individual JSON files for each participant

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
.
â”œâ”€â”€ DG.py                       # Main script
â”œâ”€â”€ Cognitive_Dataset/          # Folder with per-participant datasets (generated after running)
â”œâ”€â”€ cognitive_bias_dataset.json # Combined dataset file
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                        # Store your API keys here
â””â”€â”€ README.md                   # Project documentation

By default, it generates:

5 participants, each answering 60 questions.

Saves output to cognitive_bias_dataset(41-45).json + individual files in Cognitive_Dataset/.

You can modify parameters in main() inside DG.py:

NUM_PARTICIPANTS = 10
QUESTIONS_PER_PARTICIPANT = 50

ðŸ“Š Output Example

Each participant file (e.g., P01.json) looks like this:

{
  "participant_id": "P01",
  "dialogue": [
    {
      "question_id": "Q01",
      "question": "Should I invest in cryptocurrency right now?",
      "ai_suggestion": "AI suggests digital currencies have shown massive growth potential in recent years.",
      "participant_answer": "Cryptocurrency seems like the future; Iâ€™d definitely invest now.",
      "bias_type": "Anchoring",
      "confidence": 82
    }
  ]
}
